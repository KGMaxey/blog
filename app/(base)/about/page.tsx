I am also writing this blog for a few more... selfish reasons. Effective communication through writing is a highly underrated skill for software developers. Writing allows us to share ideas, explain problems, and develop solutions. More importantly, it allows us to do it asynchronously saving us both time and effort. The problem is, writing is hard. It's a skill that takes practice and effort to hone into something actually useful.`}

In the spirit of that async nature, it will also allow me to build up a portfolio of my knowledge and skills to point to for future job prospects. Like I said selfish reasons ðŸ˜ƒ.`}
